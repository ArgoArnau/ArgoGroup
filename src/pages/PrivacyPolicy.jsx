              We work from Spain and the USA, and some of our providers are based in the United States. When personal data of EU users is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on the safeguards each provider offers, such as the EU–US Data Privacy Framework or the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

              Depending on your state of residence, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete the personal information we hold about you, and to opt out of certain processing, including the use of your data for targeted advertising.

            <h2>11. Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              When you first visit, a banner asks whether you accept cookies. On our landing pages, the form also offers an optional box to accept them when you send it. Until you accept, we set no advertising cookies and send nothing to Meta.
            </p>
            <p>
              On our landing pages (/growth and /systems), that applies in the European Union and the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, and whenever we cannot tell where you are visiting from (the page asks our server for your country, derived from your IP address and not stored). Everywhere else, the Meta Pixel's measurement cookies are on by default: they load when the page opens, the banner tells you so, and you can reject them at any time from that banner (the "Cookies" link at the bottom of the page brings it back). After you reject, nothing more is sent to Meta, on that visit or later ones.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span className="legal-term">Always:</span> your cookie choice, stored in your browser so we do not ask again, and, on our landing pages, the campaign details of your visit, kept in your browser only for that visit.</li>
              <li><span className="legal-term">Only if you accept (or, outside the EU/EEA, the UK and Switzerland, on our landing pages, until you reject):</span> the Meta Pixel, which sets Meta's cookies (_fbp and _fbc, kept for up to 90 days) and tells Meta which pages you visited and whether you sent a form, so we can measure our ads. With your consent, we may also send the same events to Meta from our servers (Meta Conversions API). When you send one of our landing page forms while the Pixel is active for you, our server tells Meta about it together with your email address, phone number, name and country, converted into one-way codes (SHA-256 hashes) so Meta can match your request to the ad you saw. These details never reach Meta in readable form.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can change your choice at any time with the "Cookie Settings" link at the bottom of every page ("Cookies" on our landing pages), or by clearing your browser's data for this site. Every cookie and stored item, with its purpose and duration, is listed in our <Link to="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</Link>. Meta's own use of this data is described in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta's Privacy Policy</a>.

            <p>
              We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure: access to our CRM is limited to the Group ARGO partners, and our forms reach it only through an authenticated connection. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
